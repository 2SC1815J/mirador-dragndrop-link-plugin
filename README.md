A Mirador plugin that adds the IIIF drag and drop link to every window.

To enable it, include the CSS and the JavaScript (**after** loading Mirador).

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="<url to the plugin>/dragndrop-link.css" />
...
<script src="<url to the plugin>/dragndrop-link.js"></script>
```

## Acknowledgements

The most of this plugin (source code, description, etc.) is owed to “ManifestButton” a part of “[dbmdz] / [mirador-plugins]” (MIT License, Digital Library/Munich Digitization Center at Bavarian State Library). I would like to thank [dbmdz] for their activities.
